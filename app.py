'''
Upload CSV of comments (with likes and replies), then run the app which uses BERTopic to extract topics from the comments.
App aggregates engagement metrics (likes, replies, comment count) by topic. 
We can modify the code and run the provided data when we get it. 

*** Make sure you're using Python 3.8-3.11 or Streamlit/BERTopic won't work ***
